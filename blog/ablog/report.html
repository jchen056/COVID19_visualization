                <p>COVID-19 vaccines help not only protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death, but also protect against infection. Even though people who are vaccinated may still get COVID-19, 
                    they are much less likely to experience severe symptoms than people who are unvaccinated. The scenario in which people who are vaccinated get COVID-19 is referred to as a “<b>vaccine breakthrough infection</b>.”</br>
                    In this blog post, we are going to examine the breakthrough Covid-19 infection. </p>

                <h3>Data</h3>
                <p>We are provided with three datasets:<br/>
                    <ol><li><a href="https://www.healthdata.org/covid/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-summary">"Covid-19 Vaccine Efficacy.xlsx"</a></li>
                        <li>"vaccination-data-WHO-12-28-2022-NO-DETAILS for-vaciinetype-date.xlsx"</li>
                        <li>"owid-covid-data-ALL-COUNTRIES.xlsx"</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>The first dataset is about <b>vaccine efficacy</b>, which measures the effectiveness of vaccines against infection and symptomatic and severe disease(hospitalization and death). As we can see from the table below,
                the effectiveness wanes over time as new variants emerge.</p><br/>
